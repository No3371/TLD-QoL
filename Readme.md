# TLD-QoL

This is a QoL mod for The Long Dark.

## Dependencies

- [KeyboardUtilites by ds8678](https://github.com/ds5678/KeyboardUtilities)

## Features

- **Alternative Back button**: Alternative to ESC. Default is Mouse3.
- **Alternative Interact button**: Alternative to Left Click.
    - Need to change the key, default is LMB, which is no effect if your Interact is default.
    - (My personal preference is F with Status moved to H, Put Away moved to Mouse4)
- **Stack Transfer**: Without operating the PickUnits UI, transfer a whole stack of items between the inventory and containers by holding the key.
    - Default is Left Shift.
    - Note: Somehow the first usage after launch will unintentionally close the interface.
- **Fast Pickup**: Directly "Take It" items by holding Interact for a bit then release.
    - The triggering duration can be configured.
- **QuickDrop**: Press a key to drop items from inventory.
    - Default is Q. 
    - If the stack is big enough to trigger the PickUnits UI, the StackTransfer Key works too.
- **BuikPickUnits**: Hold the StackTransfer Key to increase/decrease the units by 5.
