# TLD-QoL

This is a QoL mod for The Long Dark.

## Dependencies

- [KeyboardUtilites by ds8678](https://github.com/ds5678/KeyboardUtilities)

## Features

- **Alternative Back button**: Alternative to ESC. Default is Mouse3.
- **Alternative Interact button: Alternative to Left Click. Need to change the key, default is LMB, which is no effect if your Interact is default. (My personal preference is F with Status moved to H, Put Away moved to Mouse4)
- **Stack Transfer**: When moving item between the inventory and containers, holding this can move the whole stack, skipping the unit selection UI. Default is Left Shift.
    - Note: Somehow the first usage after launch will unintentionally close the interface.
- **Fast Pickup**: When picking up items, holding interact for a little longer then release can directly "Take It". The triggering duration can be configured.
